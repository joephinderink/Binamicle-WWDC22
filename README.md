### Binamicle

`Joep Hinderink` `WWDC22` `Swift Student Challenge`

My name is Joep Hinderink and I live in The Netherlands. For the Swift Student Challenge 2022 I submitted Binamicle and it got accepted. 
The app translates text to a binary numeral system captured from:
* Images
* Speech
* Typing

You first enter an onboarding screen after which you have to follow all the steps. Finishing all these steps will lead you to a home screen where you can try everything again.

On [this](https://github.com/wwdc/2022) page you can also explore other (accepted) submissions.
