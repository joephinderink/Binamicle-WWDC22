# Binamicle by Joep Hinderink

> üèÜ Accepted submission for the Apple Swift Student Challenge 2022

`Joep Hinderink` `WWDC22` `Swift Student Challenge`

My name is Joep Hinderink and I live in The Netherlands. For the Swift Student Challenge 2022 I submitted Binamicle and it got accepted. The app translates text to a binary numeral system captured from:

- Images
- Speech
- Typing

You first enter an onboarding screen after which you have to follow all the steps. Finishing all these steps will lead you to a home screen where you can try everything again.

Download the entire project from [**this**](https://github.com/joephinderink/Binamicle-WWDC22) repository.

On [this](https://github.com/wwdc/2022) page you can also explore other (accepted) submissions.
